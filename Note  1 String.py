#Single and Double Quotes 
#Single quotes are used for string literals, 'my-identifier'
#Double qoutes are used for word-for-word quotation.

print("Hello!\nHello!\nHello!")
# Instead of having multiple print statements, we can add
# "\n" or new line to print it twice.


#String Concatenation
print("Hello" + " " + "Elysia") 
# We combined two strings together in this print statement.
#but it outputs "HelloElsyia"
# add " " will add a space in between.
# or you can add space after "Hello " or space before " Elysia"
